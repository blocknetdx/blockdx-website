  subheader: Why Block DX
  intro: Many exchanges *claim* to be decentralized while hiding the details of centralized components. Block DX is the only exchange that decentralizes every component. __*Decentralized. Trustless. Secure. Private. Open. Uncensored. Unstoppable.*__
  items:
    - feature: Decentralized Order Books
      icon: <i class="fas fa-network-wired"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Traders broadcast their orders over a peer-to-peer network and each trader compiles the orderbook locally themselves. Unlike on-chain order books which enable frontrunning, with Block DX no one can get orders faster than anyone else by being closer to the server, since there is no server.
    - feature: Decentralized Order Matching
      icon: <i class="fas fa-wave-square"></i> # Do not translate
      description: All order matching is performed locally. As an order is taken, Block DX automatically begins communicating with the counterparty over the peer-to-peer network to conduct the trade. No third parties control this, all action is self-sovereign.
    - feature: Non-custodial
      icon: <i class="fas fa-wallet"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Trading occurs directly from your own wallets and your funds remain in your control throughout the entire trade process. This means there's no third-party control over your funds, no need to transfer funds to another account, no waiting for deposit or withdrawal confirmations, and no withdrawal limits.
    - feature: Trustless
      icon: <i class="fas fa-shield-alt"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Block DX allows you to securely trade with no middlemen or intermediaries, keeping you in control of your funds throughout the entire trade process. All trading logic, operations, verifications, and checks are also performed locally.
    - feature: Private
      icon: <i class="fas fa-user-secret"></i> # Do not translate
      description: No accounts, KYC, AML, or registration process are required since trading is purely peer-to-peer. As a result, no legal responsibility is created that would require registration to use Block DX. This protects your personal privacy and gives you true financial freedom.
    - feature: Native Assets, On-chain
      icon: <i class="fas fa-coins"></i> # Do not translate
      description: No wrapped proxy tokens or coloured coins are used in place of native assets. Many "DEXes" give you a wrapped marker (e.g. wBTC) to represent your real funds (e.g. BTC). This removes your sovereignty over your funds and requires you to trust this entity, smart contract, or third-party chain.
    - feature: Instant Trades
      icon: <i class="fas fa-bolt"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Trades on Block DX are extremely fast. Many people believe that atomic swaps means that the trades are slow, but that depends on implementation. With Block DX the trade times are independent of the block times of the assets being traded.
    - feature: Open Source
      icon: <i class="fab fa-github"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Block DX is entirely open source, enabling the community to review, audit, and contribute to Block DX freely and transparently. As a result, you may subject the code to high levels of scrutiny to satisfy your need for security no matter how high your standards are.
    - feature: Uncensored
      icon: <i class="fas fa-globe-americas"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Listings and access to the exchange are open and uncensored. There are no restrictions on what users or regions have access to the exchange since there are no accounts and trading is decentralized. Listings are also decentralized with no single party that controls what assets can be traded.
    - feature: Lower Fees
      icon: <i class="fab fa-creative-commons-nc"></i> # Do not translate
      description: On Block DX there are lower trading fees and no withdrawal fee since trades are conducted directly from your wallets. While there are network fees of the assets being traded, this is a fee that exists when sending funds to and from other exchange addresses.
    - feature: Unstoppable
      icon: <i class="fas fa-laptop-code"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Block DX is always online since it doesn't require accounts or any central entity to function. The true peer-to-peer nature of the exchange makes it impossible to shut down, offers zero downtime, and built-in DoS protection.
    - feature: Atomic Swaps
      icon: <i class="fab fa-react"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Trade settlement is decentralized through the use of atomic swaps. Atomic swaps control the exchange of funds between you and your counterparty and are completely "trustless", meaning that you can safely trade with anyone without having to trust their intentions.
    - feature: Fee Sharing
      icon: <i class="fas fa-hand-holding-usd"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Some protocols return profits to a company or developer team, but this is a rent-seeking activity that enriches a central actor and does not fairly distribute fees. With Block DX, 100% of trade fees are distributed among [nodes]({{ site.exlink_docs_snodes }}) on the network. No trade fees are paid to a central entity.
    - feature: Cross-chain
      icon: <i class="fas fa-exchange-alt"></i> # Do not translate
      description: There are no restrictions to only trading assets of a certain chain. You can trade between Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dash, Syscoin, Digibyte, and more than 100 other assets from different blockchains with complete trading pair freedom. Block DX aims to integrate all platforms and assets.
    - feature: Liquidity Network
      icon: <i class="fas fa-layer-group"></i> # Do not translate
      description: Block DX is powered by the Blocknet Protocol. All services using the Blocknet Protocol have a shared order book and contribute to the same liquidity pool, including Block DX. This creates a network effect for liquidity.

  subheader: Frequently Asked Questions
  questions:
    - question: What is the difference between Block DX, Blocknet, and BLOCK?
      answer: Block DX is a decentralized exchange dApp. The exchange is powered by [Blocknet]({{ site.exlink_docs }}), a blockchain interoperability protocol project that enables communication, interaction, and exchange between different public and private blockchains. [BLOCK]({{ site.exlink_docs_blockchain }}) is the token used to pay fees for the services on Blocknet's network, including decentralized exchange, decentralized off-chain oracle data, decentralized SPV network, and decentralized microservices.

    - question: How is Block DX different from other decentralized exchanges?
      answer: >-
        Many exchanges claim to be decentralized while hiding the details of centralized components. Block DX is the only exchange that decentralizes every component. See [Features]({{ baseurl | append: lang.global.link_features }}) for how Block DX is the most secure and decentralized exchange. A comparison table with other projects is also in the works.
      topic: general # Do not translate
    - question: Is BLOCK needed to use Block DX?
      answer: A small amount of BLOCK is required to take an existing order, but no BLOCK is required to create an order. If you need BLOCK to take an order, you can either create an order to buy BLOCK on Block DX or purchase BLOCK from [various other exchanges]({{ site.exlink_docs_exchanges }}). See [Fees]({{ lang.global.link_fees }}) for additional details.
      topic: general, block, trading # Do not translate
    - question: Does Block DX have an app?
      answer: At the moment Block DX does not have an app and is only available as a desktop application. However, a third party is developing the world's first decentralized lite multiwallet on the [Blocknet Protocol]({{ site.exlink_docs }}), which would render a browser-based exchange and app possible.
      topic: general, dev, trading # Do not translate
    - question: Who is developing Block DX?
      answer: Block DX is being developed and maintained by [Blocknet]({{ site.exlink_docs }}), a blockchain interoperability protocol project that enables communication, interaction, and exchange between different public and private blockchains.
      topic: general, dev # Do not translate
    - question: Will ETH, ERC20, EOS, NEO, etc be listed?
      answer: Yes, the goal is to integrate all platforms and assets. The first to be integrated will be ETH and there has already been a test trade performed, but there is no estimated time for completion.
      topic: general, dev, listings # Do not translate
    - question: Will Monero be listed?
      answer: Unfortunately Monero is not currently capable of atomic swaps so at the moment it can not be listed.
      topic: general, dev, listings # Do not translate
    - question: How can I invest in Block DX?
      answer: There are multiple ways you can support Block DX and more importantly [Blocknet]({{ site.exlink_docs }}), the blockchain interoperability protocol powering the exchange. You can purchase [BLOCK]({{ site.exlink_docs_blockchain }}), which is the token used for fees for the services on Blocknet's network, including decentralized exchange, decentralized off-chain oracle data, decentralized SPV network, and decentralized microservices. You can also setup a [Service Nodes]({{ site.exlink_docs_snodes }}), which can monetize these services and earn 100% of the fees generated.
      topic: general, block, blocknet # Do not translate
    - question: Can Block DX be used with Electrum, hardware wallets, lite wallets, or web wallets like MyEtherWallet?
      answer: Block DX is not currently compatible with Electrum, hardware wallets, lite wallets, or web wallets. The full node of the blockchains you want to trade must be downloaded and synced, along with the [Blocknet wallet]({{ site.exlink_wallet_download }}) (used to power the exchange process). However, a third party is developing the world's first decentralized lite multiwallet on the [Blocknet Protocol]({{ site.exlink_docs }}), which will allow Block DX to be used without downloading the blockchains of the assets being traded.
      topic: general, trading  # Do not translate
    - question: How can a project get listing on Block DX?
      answer: There is no cost to be listed on Block DX. However, since Block DX utilizes atomic swaps, the asset's blockchain must meet certain compatibility and testing requirements. See [Listing Application]({{ lang.global.link_listing_application }}) for more information.
      topic: general, listings, dev # Do not translate
    - question: Can Block DX be used in the browser?
      answer: At the moment Block DX is only available as a desktop application. However, a third party is developing the world's first decentralized lite multiwallet on the [Blocknet Protocol]({{ site.exlink_docs }}), which would render a browser-based exchange and app possible.
      topic: general, trading # Do not translate
    - question: How long do trades take?
      answer: Even though native assets are exchanged and trades are settled on their respective blockchain, the trade times are independent of block times. Block DX is very fast with trades typically being completed in 5-15 seconds.
      topic: general, trading # Do not translate
    - question: Why isn't Block DX listed on CoinMarketCap?
      answer: An application has already been submitted for Block DX to be listed as an exchange on CoinMarketCap and we are waiting to be listed.
      topic: general # Do not translate
    - question: Does Block DX have an API?
      answer: Yes! Block DX is 100% bot-friendly, see Blocknet's [API docs]({{ site.exlink_api_xbridge }}) for setup and usage documentation. There is also a [market making bot]({{ site.exlink_makerbot }}) that can be used to automatically post orders based off specified price data sources.
